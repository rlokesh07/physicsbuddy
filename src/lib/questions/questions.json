			"In order for something to be simple harmonic motions, the acceleration has to be proportional to the displacement, and the acceleration and displacement are in opposite directions (because the spring pulls in the opposite direction). That means your displacement needs to be linear, and a negative sign to make the result negative when x is positive"
